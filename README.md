# My GitHub Profile
This repository hosts my personal GitHub profile page.

This is a forked repository from the [academicpages/academicpages.github.io](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). The profile page provides an overview of my GitHub activities, repositories, and contributions.

I would like to express my gratitude to [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) for the template.
